# Social Tracker
This app helps users find the shortest path between people in a social network. Users load data from a specified DOT file which converts the links in the file into nodes. These nodes are then placed into a DirectedNode class within the DijkstraGraph, enabling the lookup of the shortest path between two users connected by mutual friends, among other provided statistics.
